Runner game 2.5D with pixels and sprites

This simple game is inspired from adventure works like Indiana Jones, the Mummy, Tomb Rider, Uncharted, Temple Run or Uncle Scrooge. (yes, never read The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, with the zombie ?).
It's almost a rule that when an adventurer take a treasure from a temple, a monster or something really bad immediately shows up to destroy them/the world.    
    
I've always liked this simple illustration of the "Greed is Vain" concept, and I've always thought it's a pitty that there is not more works inspired from this genre. So when the time came for me to make a sample game project using Three.js with SpriteMixer for sprite animations, I chose to make this.    
     
Have fun playing it !
